# E-Commerce Back End

## Task

My task was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code, using an Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.


## User Story

```md

SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### THE USER CAN: 
1. Add database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
2. Connect to a database using Sequelize
